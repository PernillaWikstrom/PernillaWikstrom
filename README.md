### Hi there 👋

<!--
**PernillaWikstrom/PernillaWikstrom** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working in Robotics as I love coding and being creative.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about C and C++ as I want to expand my software skills, which is why I am taking some courses at Udemy.
- 💬 Ask me about Python, C++ or C.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Our eyes are not able to see the real colors of northen lights captured by a camera due to the darkness!

I have just finished a course Learn Advanced Modern C++ on Udemy with James Reynard: ude.my/UC-2022438d-23d1-4f71-807b-3213c1cc4762/
