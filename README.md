### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in Robotics as I love coding and being creative.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about C and C++ as I want to expand my software skills, which is why I am taking some courses at Udemy.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, C++ or C.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Our eyes are not able to see the real colors of northen lights captured by a camera due to the darkness!

I have just finished a course Learn Advanced Modern C++ on Udemy with James Reynard: [Certificate](ude.my/UC-2022438d-23d1-4f71-807b-3213c1cc4762/).
