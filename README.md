### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working in Robotics as I love coding and being creative.
- :mortar_board: I have a masters degree in Computer Science and Engineering from KTH specializing in systems, control and robotics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about ROS and MPC as I want to expand my skills, which is why I am taking some courses at Udemy.
- 💬 Ask me about Python, C++ or C.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Our eyes are not able to see the real colors of northen lights captured by a camera due to the darkness!
